Please join us for CosmoPalooza, a resurrection of the special sessions planned for the AAS 239th meeting by CMB-S4, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, the Dark Energy Survey, and the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration. 
Each collaboration will present its latest developments, plans, and science advances with an exciting slate of speakers, on Wednesday, January 12 and Thursday, January 13. 
All four sessions will be presented in Zoom webinars. Everyone is welcome to join in to hear about the latest on cosmology and astrophysics from the Big Bang to the nearby universe!
Best regards and happy new year,
CMB-S4, DES, DESC, DESI Collaborations

Note that the video recordings will only be available for 60 days.
